Problem Statement:
    Map a set of resources with defined abilities and constraints onto a set of shifts with requirement abilities and constraints. Find a solution with a "good" qualitative score that meets are hard contraints

    Hard Constraints(Binary Result) and Soft Constraints(Qualitative Score)

Input File Requirements:
Data needed:
    Resources
        Data about the resources(i.e. nurses, etc.)
        Roles they can fill.
        Limits
    Shifts
        Time details of shifts - number of shifts, start/stop time, required roles
    Roles
        Skills required.

A schedule is a list of shifts each with a start and stop time and a role(s) required.

Initial Data for Each
Resources - Database
    Personal
    Role
    Role Limits
    Overall Limits

Shifts - Database
    Start/Top Time
    Roll Requirement
    Assocative Roll - scheduled at the same time - or specific overlaps.

Schedule - Database
    List of shifts.
    Limits to shifts.
    Master limits for Resources - max number of hours(total, consecutive
